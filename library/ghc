# The 'latest' is set is version 7.6.3 on Ubuntu 14.904 which is currently
# the latest GHC version that can be built with apt-get. We should
# soon add support for version 7.6.8 which could be done by
# tryung to install the .xz build and configure it, or by trying
# to build from source. Or we can wait until 7.6.3 has a package
# ready for deployment via apt-get.
